============

_Donate a cup of coffee, because coffee == <3_

Setup
-----

Just fork this repository on github and make sure you are in the gh-pages branch. Feel free to delete my version of the
gh-pages branch and create a new gh-pages branch from master. (`git branch gh-pages && git checkout gh-pages`)
Now search for "CUSTOM" in the index.html file. Those comments tell you what to replace to get your custom coffee-based
donation page! It will be available at http://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/coffeedonate/ - Awesomeness!
